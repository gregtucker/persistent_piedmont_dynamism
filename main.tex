\section*{NOTES}

Knepper 2005:

"Because the gravel is more
resistant than the underlying bedrock, modern streams are established over the Pleistocene drainage
divides, where the gravel was thinnest. Thicker gravel in the Pleistocene paleovalleys now caps modern
drainage divides, producing an inverted topography."

Fan has boulder, cobble, pebble gravel

RF 25 km2. E edge dissected by Rock, Walnut, Woman, Big Dry Cks, Barbara Gulch. N-trending K Laramie and Fox Hills pokes thru gravel in 4 places. He's looking @ aggregate potential of mtn front fans. 

Drilling, trenching, seismic, and ER showed big variation in thickness. DA Lindsey interps flash flood deposits; no ev DFs.

There's a small remnant "older gravel" 12-30 m above.
